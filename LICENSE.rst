I did start from the existing files from the public repositories of `RhodeCode
Enterprise`_ and the `RhodeCode VCSServer`_.

The sources of the vcsserver are licensed as GPLv3, the sources of enterprise
are licensed as AGPLv3. I assume that the derived files inside of the respective
folders of this repository inherit these licenses and can also be integrated
back based on these terms.
