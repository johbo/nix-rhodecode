===========================================================
 Adjusted Nix derivations to build Rhodecode Enterprise CE
===========================================================


Purpose
=======

This repository is my personal experimentation area to figure out how to build
the community edition of `RhodeCode Enterprise`_ with the package manager Nix_.
My intention is to run an instance of `RhodeCode Enterprise`_ as a NixOS_
service.
